# Analyzing Democratic Primary Data

This repository contains files collected & created while analyzing Democratic presidential primary data. So far, this project contains two branches:
- [Polls](https://github.com/hassenmorad/Democratic-Primaries/tree/master/Polls) 
- [Campaign Contributions](https://github.com/hassenmorad/Democratic-Primaries/tree/master/Campaign%20Contributions)

A summary of my findings thus far can be found in the following articles:
#### [Addressing the "Landline Only" PollingÂ Myth](https://medium.com/@hassen.morad/addressing-the-landline-only-polling-myth-473dbb6d46bd?source=friends_link&sk=b4f11605e33fff99f8d1b93cf0ec27ea)
#### [Shedding Light on DNC-Approved Polls](https://medium.com/@hassen.morad/shedding-light-on-dnc-approved-polls-773947e464e3)

*Future analyses will tackle the following questions: 
- Does mapping candidate donations reveal any patterns of support from certain racial groups or regions?
- How do candidates compare w/ regards to momentum in key metrics?
